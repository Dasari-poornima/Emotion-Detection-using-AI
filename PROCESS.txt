EMOTION DETECTION USING AI


3 STEPS involved
1.collecting the dataset for various emotion.
2.applying deep learning for training the prediction model.
3.using the model to predict the emotion.


Step 1:preparing dataset
1.we have5 classes 
   angry
   happy
   neutral
   sad
   surprise
step 2:
TRAINING OUR PREDICTION MODEL
in this we have 3 steps.
1.import required libraries
2.use the images&labels for training the model.
3.Train the model using keras&tensorflow based on given parameters
step 3: Emotion detection using ai
we require 3 source files.
1.Face Classifier(xml file)=This classifier will be used for face detection(it will dtect whether any face is there or not because once the face is detected then only we can detect the emotion)
2.Emotion Detection(h5 file)=This ids the training model which will be predicting the emotion
3.test.py=This python file will be the executing this project
